This came up on Twitter yesterday and I had previously dug into this a good while ago for myself so I figured I'd write a short post about it. I don't have kids so I don't use the 'Kids' Netflix profile for anything.

1. Login to Netflix's '[Manage Accounts](https://www.netflix.com/ManageProfiles)' page.
1. Click the Edit (pencil icon) for the 'Kids' profile.
1. Click 'Delete Profile' at the bottom and confirm on the following page.

This should remove it when logging in from other devices as well. The next thing Netflix could do is bypass profile selection entirely if there's only one profile, or allow you to select a default.
