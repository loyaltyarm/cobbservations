This is the initial post in a series of steps I am taking to move [Cobbservations](https://cobbservations.wordpress.com) to a site powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). I stumbled across `hugo` recently while working with the maintainers of the [`micromdm`](https://github.com/micromdm) project. The [beautiful site](https://micromdm.io) hosting the documentation is build with `hugo`, and given the looks, I just _had_ to try it. 

Somewhat separately, I've been using [Markdown](http://www.markdowntutorial.com) for quite a while and have finally gotten around to enjoying it more than standard wordpress-style content for blogging. I even recently re-formatted all of my [splunk repo](https://github.com/loyaltyarm/splunk) searches to a more uniform Markdown syntax. So, I'm undertaking a project of moving my blog contents over to Github hosting and plan to use `hugo` to maintain it.

Lastly, one of the main features I like about Wordpress is its social network integration. This makes it super easy to update your LinkedIn network or Twitter followers that you've published a new post. I'm going to try to include this functionality in the `hugo` site when I get more time to figure out how to get that going.
