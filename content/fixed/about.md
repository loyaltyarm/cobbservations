I'm currently an Engineering Manager at [Uber Advanced Technologies](https://www.uberatc.com), leading the growth of an infrastructure organization. We're responsible for things like cloud platforms, compute schedulers and clusters, distributed storage systems, machine learning platforms, and big data toolsets and systems. Prior to my time as an Engineering Manager, I spent time as a Sr. Systems Engineer focused on providing infrastructure as a service to a distributed team of engineers working on self-driving cars and trucks.

In previous years at Uber, I built, managed, and supported mobile continuous integration infrastructure for our massive mobile engineering organization. In addition, I also provided full support for Uber's global core business operations in areas such as endpoint management, telecommunications strategy, network topologies, and scalability planning and design. If you want to know more about what I did before Uber, reach out to me!

I try to regularly [speak at conferences](https://github.com/loyaltyarm/speaking) and am a fan of baseball and bodybuilding. I also travel regularly and enjoy trying new restaurants with friends and family. My current challenges include learning how to be a (new) uncle and discovering ways to advance my technology learning.
