I recently had the privilege to give a talk at [MacDevOpsYVR 2017](https://macdevops.ca) about quite a large undertaking of ours at Uber last year. Myself and two other engineers, [Olivier Lessard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivier-lessard-96855235/) and [Kenneth Peterson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenneth-peterson-06a80a56/) built a massive macOS virtualization platform to support iOS development efforts at Uber during the Rider app rewrite. This infrastructure facilitates the automated continuous integration platform used to build and test Uber's mobile applications.

Check out the talk below:
